              Here are some things to think about before the competition begins:

              1. **Where are you coding?** The [locations page] has great options.
              2. **What tools should you use?** Check out our [tutorials] and
              [free services] provided by sponsors.
              3. **How are you going to win?** See the [rules] and [scoring page].

              **Keep an eye out.** We'll set up [GitHub repos] and [Nodejitsu]
              accounts for teams soon.

            **Something horribly broken?** Use this grace period to activate any
            snapshot you've previously deployed. Use `jitsu snapshots activate`
            ([docs](http://handbook.jit.su/#Snapshots)) to do this.

            **Everything peachy?** Make sure your app is submitted for voting.
            The top of your [team page](/teams/mine) should look like this:

          ul.steps
            li.done: a( href='/teams/mine' ) Deploy
            li.done: a( href='/teams/mine' ) Entry info

            ### Demo Time!!

            Your final submission for the competition should now be deployed.
            If you&rsquo;re still standing, we&rsquo;ve got time for some quick
            demos.

            ### Grace period extended

            We'll get everyone deployed. The mad rush of everyone trying to
            deploy to Nodejitsu was a bit much. Huge sorry for not anticipating
            all the enthusiam.

            Feel free to keep trying to deploy your code on Nodejitsu. #nodejitsu
            on IRC is the best place to get some help.

            Code changes to fix any last minute deploy issues for the next hour
            __are__ going to be allowed. No other code changes are allowed.

              2. **Design** - How good does it look and feel to use?
              3. **Utility / Fun** - Is the site offering a service I'd use again and again?
              4. **Completeness** - How "fully baked" is the site? Are there bugs or dead ends?

              Please try to [grade along a curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve)
              with an **average score of 3.5 stars**.

              review finalists with other judges.

              Since many of the apps are likely to be multiplayer, it will be a
              ton of fun to judge them together, so bring your laptop or tablet.

              _The brunch video feed will be posted here before the event begins._
