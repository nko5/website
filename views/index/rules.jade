          ### Node.js

          All applications must be built using node.js™. This isn't to say you
          can't use additional technology to _supplement_ node.js™, like MongoDB™.

          <h3 id="duration">48 Hours</h3>

          You've got precisely 48 hours to develop your web app during the Knockout,
          not a minute more. The competition kicks off at [12:00 AM / 00:00 UTC on
          November 7, 2015][start time] and ends at [11:59:59 PM / 23:59:59 UTC on November
          8, 2015][end time]. Be sure you understand what time that translates to in
          your local time zone.

          Of course, feel free to work on the _concept_ for your application before the
          competition starts: pretty hand-drawn pictures on napkins, angry email
          threads between team members on two-space or four-space indentation, schema
          designs, finite state machines. Just no digital assets including graphic
          design assets, code, etc.

          After those 48 hours are up, judging will ensue. No additional features or
          bug fixes are allowed during judging, or you will be disqualified. Please
          don't make us disqualify you; we'll be very sad.

          <h3 id="teams">Teams and Contestants</h3>

          Teams are comprised of between one to four individuals. No more than four
          people are allowed on a team (and no less than one). To be eligible, teams
          must register at least one week prior to the start of the competition (space
          subject to availability). Individuals don't need to be programmers nor even
          know node.js, but both of those definitely help.

          No worries if you work for a sponsor: they won't be able to influence the
          judging process. Moreover, don't worry if you know a judge either: we'll
          prevent judges from voting on a team they know personally and they're
          committed to stay impartial.

          <h3 id="scm">Source Control</h3>

          Source code will be hosted in a shiny, free git repository provided by
          [GitHub]. We'll send GitHub repo access information before the competition
          starts. Your team should push regularly to show progress. We'll be watching
          to make sure people don't cheat (don't think you can develop everything ahead
          of time and push it all at the end; we know lots of git tricks too).

          <h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

          [Modulus] will provide free, private instances to deploy your code to
          during the competition. Expect login information before the competition
          starts.

          In order to ensure that no code is changed during the judging week, all
          contestants must deploy their apps to the [Modulus] instances provided
          for the competition. You cannot deploy to any other server, no matter how
          face-meltingly awesome it is.

          Entries will remain up until winners are announced. During judging, we will
          have access to make sure there is no cheating, including comparing deployed
          code with that in the git repo. After the 48-hour deadline, you will still
          be allowed to restart processes, free up disk space, and other general
          sysadmin tasks, including playing lots of StarCraft 2.

          <h3 id="web">Web Application</h3>

          Entries _should_ be web applications. It's hard for judges (especially the
          general public) to fairly evaluate entries that require compilation or setup.
          If you want to submit a non-web app, you're welcome to, but you aren't likely
          to get judged fairly. If an app is not a website, but some library, utility,
          or desktop program, then it must be deployed to the [npm] registry.

          If you do decide to submit something that isn't immediately accessible via
          the web, then we encourage you to think of a clever way to share it as a
          website (e.g. via [VNC]) or market it (e.g. [jQuery Quicksand]).

          <h3 id="technical">Technical Entries</h3>

          If you want to make sure that the expert judges looking at your app have a
          technical background, you'll have an option to label your entry so. We'll
          assign technical judges accordingly, but there are no guarantees that your
          assigned judges will have any given specific expertise. Also, other
          non-technical judges may still be called on to judge your app if technical
          entries greatly outnumber technical judges.

          <h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>

          Libraries, plugins, and modules that are public and freely available are
          allowed and encouraged. During judging, please list all libraries that you
          use on your team's profile page to give credit where it's due. Stock photos
          and free icon sets are allowed. Paying for something that is not generally
          available to everyone else is not allowed, and not nice.

          Developing a library in secret before the competition that provides the same
          general functionality of your entry and releasing it a day before will
          likely get you disqualified and called sneaky. On the other hand, developing
          a library that is publicly available and provides a general-purpose, publicly
          usable function can be done before the competition begins.

          <h3 id="services">Web Services</h3>

          We encourage use of third-party web services and their APIs (e.g. Twitter,
          Flickr, Google maps). Almost everyone loves mashups.  Again, make sure to
          update your team profile with what services you use.

          <h3 id="ownership">Ownership and Open Source</h3>

          The code you write is yours. If you intend to share it after the competition,
          you can pick whatever license you love. We encourage contestants to open
          source their code, but it's totally up to you. If you want to start a
          business based on it, awesome.

          Note however, we will have access to your GitHub repository during the
          competition to audit for cheating, but we won't steal any of your secret
          recipes or patent-pending algorithms. Stealing will get us disqualified.

          <h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>

          Winners will be picked by a mixture of voting by judges, contestants, and
          the general public. <a href="/scoring">Read more...</a>

          <h3 id="misc">Miscellany</h3>

          Don't break any laws. Don't harm any animals (especially [potbellied pigs]).
          Wear sunscreen and have fun. This is all for fun and glory, so don't hurt
          yourself.
