          ## For Fun

          Node Knockout is for fun. While we applaud a competitive spirt, the
          competition is about spending a weekend with other noders building awesome
          stuff, not winning prizes.

          At the end of the day, try to remember that no matter what happens to your
          score, you’ll still have had a great time, built something awesome, and
          gotten a ton of exposure for your idea.

          ## How Scoring Works

          Entries will be judged on a 1-5 scale across 4 dimensions:

          - **Innovation** - How original is the idea and execution?
          - **Design** - How good does it look and feel to use?
          - **Utility / Fun** - Is the site offering a service I'd use again and again?
          - **Completeness** - How "fully baked" is the site? Are there bugs or dead ends? Does it work in my browser?

          Additionally, a **Popularity** score will be calculated based on the number
          of votes a entry gets from the general public.

          In order to ensure all reviews are [anchored] similarly, we ask that people
          try to [grade along a curve] with a mean of 3.5.

          ## Voting

          All voting will take place between 0:00 UTC on Monday, November 9 and 0:00
          UTC on Sunday, November 15.

          There will be three groups of voters:

          1. **contestants**
          2. **expert judges**
          3. **general public**

          ## Contestants

          Due to the fact that there are many more contestants than judges, we expect
          the majority of voting in this year's Node Knockout to be done by
          contestants voting on each others’ entries.

          In order for contestant scoring to be succesful, we need lots of contestants
          to vote. To encourage this, we will only show contestants the scores for
          teams that they have judged. So if you want to know how your app is doing
          relative to the competition, you will need to vote.

          Contestants should remember that votes are attached to their public GitHub
          profiles. Also, since any contestant can vote on any other contestant's app,
          contestants should try to be as fair and balanced to others as they expect
          others to be to them.

          We reserve the right to disqualify teams from the contest for inappropriate
          or unfair judging behavior (as determined by the organizers).

          Contestants will not be allowed to vote on their own entries (because it
          would give teams with more members an unfair advantage).

          ## Expert Judges

          We have an [amazing and diverse panel of expert judges](/judges) who are
          volunteering their time to provide thoughtful feedback on contestants’
          work.

          Unfortunately, it just isn’t possible to get enough expert judges to ensure
          that every entry gets an adequate number of expert votes. Thus, this year
          **expert judges will only vote on the top entries and pitch videos will be
          required for expert judging**.

          Each expert judge will be asked to review an initial batch of 5-10 entries.
          After they do their initial batch, judges will be encouraged to review
          a handful more of the top entries that pique their interest. Experts will
          be asked not to vote for teams who they know.

          The hope is that this will allow all the top entries to get at least 2-3
          thoughtful expert reviews and that the best entries will get enough reviews
          that the [law of large numbers] ensures fairness.

          ## General Public

          General public voters will not score on 4 dimensions, but will instead simply
          vote up the entry. These votes will contribute exclusively to the entry's
          popularity and overall score.

          Any member of the general public will be allowed to vote, but Facebook login
          will be required. You are encouraged to get as many people as possible to
          vote for your work, as these votes form the entrity of the popularity
          component of your team's score.

          ## Calculation

          A team's score will be determined by combining the expert judge score and the
          contestant scores for each dimension along with the popularity component
          derived from each entry's public vote count.

          The overall score will be the average of all 5 components (innovation,
          design, utility / fun, completeness and popularity).

          ## Prizes

          There will be the following 7 prize categories:

          - **Team Overall** - the best overall score for a 2+ person team
          - **Solo Overall** - the best overall score for a one-person team
          - **Innovation** - the highest innovation score
          - **Design** - the highest design score
          - **Utility / Fun** - the highest utility / fun score
          - **Completeness** - the highest completeness score
          - **Popularity** - the entry with the most public votes

          A team may only win one prize and will earn the highest prize (in the above
          rank order) for which it qualifies, opening its spot in the running for lower
          prizes to the next most qualified team.

          See the [prizes page](/prizes) for a list of prizes.

          ## Cheating

          This is a competition for fun. The honor code applies: we're trusting you
          to do the honorable thing.

          We have implemented a number of mechanisms to detect and to eliminate ballot
          stuffing, and we will be have a zero tolerance policy towards cheating.  If
          you are provably caught cheating, you will be disqualified immediately, be
          banned from all future events, and generally be thought of as a bad person by
          all of the organizers and potentially many, many, more people.  Trust us,
          it's not worth the risk.
